Please follow this database for the csv columns schema: Question, CorrectAnswer, Option1, Option2, Option3, Reason (Make the reasons respond to the question that corresponds and answer the question fully in detail of at least 4-5 sentences. Make sure to use quotes around data, but not the headers, so commas that are within questions and answers do not disrupt the csv format and structure.)



Certainly, I'll provide you with the details of how I'm achieving the CSV format you requested so that you can remind me in the future with precise instructions.

Question Generation: I'm generating questions based on the advanced web development topics you provided. Each question is created with a correct answer, three alternative options, and a detailed reason for the correct answer.

I need you to abide by these rules below, and I will begin giving you material for exam question generation. The below rules are key to ensuring you stick to the defined database schema for the csv.

CSV Format: I'm formatting the generated questions and answers in CSV format. The format consists of six columns: Question, CorrectAnswer, Option1, Option2, Option3, and Reason. Each column is separated by commas.

Quotations: I need quotes placed around each field (not the CSV headers) because when I import these with the quotes, sentences that have commas throw off the conversion.

Reason Alignment: The reasons provided for each question are aligned with the corresponding question and answer. They are detailed explanations of the correct answer, ensuring a minimum of 4-5 sentences, aiming to provide examples or the best context for learning something as easily as possible.
