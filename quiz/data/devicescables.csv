Question,CorrectAnswer,Option1,Option2,Option3,Reason
"At which OSI model layer does a router primarily operate?",Network Layer (Layer 3),Data Link Layer (Layer 2),Physical Layer (Layer 1),Transport Layer (Layer 4),"A router primarily operates at the Network Layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model. It makes routing decisions based on logical addresses (IP addresses) to forward packets between networks."
"In the OSI model, which layer is often associated with a repeater?",Physical Layer (Layer 1),Data Link Layer (Layer 2),Network Layer (Layer 3),Transport Layer (Layer 4),"A repeater primarily operates at the Physical Layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model. It regenerates and amplifies signals to extend the reach of a network."
"At which OSI model layer does a modem primarily operate?",Physical Layer (Layer 1),Data Link Layer (Layer 2),Network Layer (Layer 3),Transport Layer (Layer 4),"A modem primarily operates at the Physical Layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model. It modulates and demodulates analog signals for transmission."
"Which network device operates at the Physical Layer and extends the range of a network by amplifying and regenerating signals?",Repeater,Switch,Bridge,Router,"A repeater operates at the Physical Layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model. It regenerates and amplifies signals to extend the reach of a network."
"At which OSI model layer is a switch typically associated?",Data Link Layer (Layer 2),Network Layer (Layer 3),Physical Layer (Layer 1),Transport Layer (Layer 4), "A switch is typically associated with the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model. It uses MAC addresses to forward frames within a local network."
"In the OSI model, which layer is primarily associated with a bridge?",Data Link Layer (Layer 2),Network Layer (Layer 3),Physical Layer (Layer 1),Transport Layer (Layer 4),"A bridge is primarily associated with the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model. It uses MAC addresses to make forwarding decisions within a network."
"Which network device operates at the Data Link Layer and connects different network segments while filtering traffic based on MAC addresses?",Bridge,Router,Switch,Modem,"A bridge operates at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model. It connects different network segments and filters traffic based on MAC addresses."
"At which OSI model layer does a router make its primary operational decisions?",Network Layer (Layer 3),Data Link Layer (Layer 2),Physical Layer (Layer 1),Transport Layer (Layer 4),"A router makes its primary operational decisions at the Network Layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model. It uses logical addresses (IP addresses) for routing decisions."
"In the OSI model, which layer is associated with a hub?",Physical Layer (Layer 1),Data Link Layer (Layer 2),Network Layer (Layer 3),Transport Layer (Layer 4),"A hub is associated with the Physical Layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model. It simply forwards data to all connected devices without making any logical decisions."
"Which network device operates at the Physical Layer and connects multiple network devices within a local area network?",Hub,Repeater,Router,Modem,"A hub operates at the Physical Layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model. It connects multiple network devices within a local area network."
"In the OSI model, which layer is often associated with a switch?",Data Link Layer (Layer 2),Network Layer (Layer 3),Physical Layer (Layer 1),Transport Layer (Layer 4),"A switch is often associated with the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model. It uses MAC addresses for forwarding decisions within a local network."
"Which network device operates at the Data Link Layer and forwards data packets based on MAC addresses within a local network?",Switch,Bridge,Router,Modem,"A switch operates at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model. It forwards data packets based on MAC addresses within a local network."
